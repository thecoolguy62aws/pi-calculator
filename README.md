# Pi Calculator

## About
The Pi Calculator is a python CLI and web app that calculates however many digits of pi you might want. I will no longer update the CLI version and it will stay with the limit of 1500 digits. Please note that if you generate a lot of digits of pi with the webpage then it may freeze for anywhere from half a second to 15 seconds while it's calculating your pi.

## Limits
Unforunately the Pi Calculator can only calculate up to 5,000,000 digits of pi on the webpage (due to concerns about computing) and 1,500 on the CLI (because of an old system which has not been updated on the CLI and has limit of 1,500 digits.).

## Installation

### Webpage
Use the GitHub hosted webpage GUI. It can be found [here](https://thecoolguy62aws.github.io/pi-calculator/). I recommend using the webpage. The webpage is the only GUI option.

### Compiled Windows EXE
***The CLI verisons of the app are no longer recomended because they're limited to 1500 digits.***

Use one of the portable EXEs found in the [releases](https://github.com/thecoolguy62aws/pi-calculator/releases) section for windows.

### Raw
***The CLI verisons of the app are no longer recomended because they're limited to 1500 digits.***

You may also download the source and with all files aranged how they are in the GitHub repo you should be able to run cli.py to start the app.

### Compile From Source
***The CLI verisons of the app are no longer recomended because they're limited to 1500 digits.***

You can also use PyInstaller to compile the code to a binary yourself.
